# Evoastra Internship Assessment – Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **Evoastra Internship Assessment**.
The project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, and **machine learning modeling** to extract insights and build a predictive solution.

The complete implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook:

## Objectives

* Understand the dataset and business problem
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Engineer useful features
* Build and evaluate machine learning models
* Interpret model performance and insights

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding

* Loaded dataset using **Pandas**
* Checked:

  * Shape of data
  * Data types
  * Missing values
  * Duplicate records
  * Statistical summary

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature scaling (if required)
* Preparing data for modeling

---

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution analysis
* Correlation analysis
* Category-wise comparisons
* Key insights and patterns from the data
* Visualization using:

  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn

---

### 4. Feature Engineering

* Selection of important features
* Encoding categorical variables
* Preparing final feature matrix for modeling

---

### 5. Model Building

Implemented machine learning models such as:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree / Random Forest (if applicable)
* Other suitable classification/regression models

Steps followed:

* Train-test split
* Model training
* Predictions
* Performance evaluation

---

### 6. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC (if classification)

---

## Key Insights

* Identified important features affecting the target variable
* Observed relationships between variables through EDA
* Built a baseline and improved model performance through preprocessing and feature selection

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
